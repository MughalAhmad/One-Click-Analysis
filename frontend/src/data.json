    "description": {
      "context": "The integration of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for admin and super admin roles in the Retail Culinary system is crucial for enhancing security and protecting sensitive data. This feature will provide an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the system. By implementing 2FA via SMS, the system will significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the data and maintaining user trust.",
      "information": [
          "The 2FA system will utilize SMS as the primary method for sending verification codes to admins and super admins.",
          "The implementation should be simple, user-friendly, and integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication system.",
          "The 2FA setup process should be accessible and manageable by the admins themselves.",
          "Error handling and logging mechanisms must be implemented to track any issues that arise during the 2FA setup or verification process.",
          "The system must validate user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).",
          "The solution should adhere to industry standards and best practices for security and authentication."
